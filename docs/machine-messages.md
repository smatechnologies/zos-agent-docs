# z/OS LSAM Machine Messages

Certain conditions on the z/OS LSAM may prevent SAM from completing a task and a message is produced indicating the source or cause of the error. The SAM is designed so that errors or invalid resource conditions do not cause a total halt of schedule processing. After reporting the error, the SAM may retry processing and may again encounter the same error and report it.

To prevent the SAM from encountering the same error repeatedly, the job(s) involved may be placed "ON HOLD", or the SAM may be placed "ON HOLD", until the error is resolved. Some errors may be resolved without operator intervention, such as a job exclusion or inclusion that cannot be satisfied. When the proper condition is satisfied, the SAM is notified by XPS390 and this resolves the error. If a condition is assigned to a DEMAND run, there may be a long time before the condition is satisfied; the SAM encounters the error repeatedly until resolution. Some messages require operator analysis or resolution; others are informational only.

## Message Syntax

Al: OpCon/xps for z/OS messages are formatted with IBM standard message notation:

XPS*nnnc*

- **XPS** is the product identifier.
- **nnn** is the message reference number.
- **c** is a message type indicator.

| Message Type	| Explanation	|
| --- 	| --- 	|
| I	| The message is Informational only.	|
| A 	| The message indicates a possible or probable operator Action is required.	|
| W 	| -   The message is a Warning message.<br/>-   Some operation or process may need review.	|
| E 	| -   The message indicates an Error condition.<br/>-   Corrective action is probable.	|
| None        	| -   If type is none of the above the message is Informational and the type indicator represents the MODULE that issued the message.<br/>-   B=XPSUBMIT<br/>-   T=XPSTATUS<br/>-   X=XPSPLEX<br/>-   V=XPSSUPV<br/>-   O=XPSYSOUT<br/>-   S=XPSERVER	|
